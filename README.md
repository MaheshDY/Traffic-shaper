Abstract the topology shown in Figure below. Station-A is sending packets towards Station-B via the Traffic Shaper. The traffic from Station-A is randomly generated following Poisson distribution. That is, the inter-arrival time between packets is Poisson distributed and hence is of variable packet rate. The traffic shaper will queue the incoming packets from A and then “schedule” them at a constant bit rate towards Station-B. Thus the traffic between Station A and the Traffic Shaper is VBR, while between the Traffic Shaper and Station-B is CBR. The traffic shaper MUST be based on Token Bucket algorithm (see lecture slides)
